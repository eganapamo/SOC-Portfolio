# Detection Engineering Lab Series

This folder showcases custom detection logic built from raw log data, simulating real SOC alert development.

## Objectives
- Build detection rules
- Identify malicious patterns
- Reduce false positives
- Simulate SIEM detection logic

## Detection Types Covered
- Failed login thresholds
- Suspicious IP detection
- Privilege escalation alerts
- Command execution monitoring
- Persistence indicators

## Detection Philosophy
Effective detection is:
- Accurate
- Contextual
- Actionable
- Tuned for signal-to-noise

## Outcome
Demonstrates ability to think like a detection engineer rather than just a log analyst.
